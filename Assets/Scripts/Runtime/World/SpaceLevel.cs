// SpaceLevel.cs
// Builds the flight level for the current station orbit at startup, like Level::init 0xbb49c (two passes) and
// MGame::reset 0x1a793c: one level = one station orbit; the other stations of the system only appear as planets.
// The world itself (sky, lights, station, jumpgate, asteroids, dust, sun/planets) comes from OrbitBuilder,
// which the main menu background uses too. This adds the flight parts:
//   createPlayer:  player ship at (10, 10, 10000) facing away from the station (+-8.8 deg), speed 2 u/ms
//   MGame::reset:  camera fov 1.22 rad, near 20, far 300000 units; chase offsets (0, 600, -1338) / (0, 600, -650)
//   MGame::dockEvent 0x1afebc: docking switches straight to the station module (no animation). The original needs the
//                  autopilot aimed at the station plus a collision or |pos| < 16000; here the HUD offers "Dock" inside
//                  16000 units once the player has flown out of that range after spawning (no autopilot yet).
//   LevelScript 0x15e650 / process 0x160d50: after launching from the station a fixed camera 9000 units ahead of the
//                  ship (+-500..2499 sideways and up) watches it fly past for 7 s, then the chase camera takes over.
//   Level::init arrival by travel (planet jump, Navigation): 4x the previous station's planet billboard (about 80000
//                  units out) or the hidden jumpgate in the gate orbit, facing the station, with the travel launch camera.
//   Navigation: station / jumpgate / planet locks, autopilot (docks at the station), planet jump, fast-forward.
//   SystemJump: the jumpgate (star map, jump scene) and the Khador Drive. Arrival from another system: the hidden gate
//                  in the gate orbit, else (0, 0, 100000); the arrival camera then shows the orbit information.
//   LevelScript::process 0x160d50: at the end of the launch / arrival camera the autopilot continues to a programmed
//                  station (Navigation.ContinueToProgrammedStation), unless the Khador Drive is about to charge.
//   Level::createMission etc.: the NPC traffic (Traffic) and ship combat: the player's pools and death
//                  (PlayerHealth), ship / salvage locks (CombatRadar); invulnerable during the launch / arrival
//                  camera and the jump scenes.
//   PlayerEgo::calcCollision: the ship slides along the station, the visible jumpgate and freighters (Obstacle,
//                  PlayerCollision), touching an asteroid destroys it; off during the launch / arrival camera and the
//                  jump scenes. MGame::dockEvent: the autopilot to the station also docks on touching the station.
//   Story (StorySpace, CampaignLevel): an orbit built around a campaign mission (Story.IsLevelMission) gets
//                  the campaign level instead of normal traffic; briefings, success / failure, the add-on entry calls. On a
//                  story mission the station refuses docking and the planet jumps / Khador Drive are blocked (525).
//   Wormhole (landmark 3): exists until the game is won, visible when coming out of the Void, at the station the Void
//                  attack or in the alien orbit (Session.VoidOrbit, the Void's home: its station, sky 010, Void asteroids);
//                  arriving from the Void it closes behind the player (LevelScript::LevelScript: player - dir * 10000,
//                  reset(true)). MGame::OnUpdate, the player inside it: an active campaign mission advances first (index
//                  < 41, not 29 / 40; 40 only once Errkt's freighter went through, carrying its hull into 41), entering too
//                  early at 29 / 40 / 41 kills the player, 42 in the alien orbit is the level script's; then the ride:
//                  into the alien orbit (remembering this station, Status+0x84) or back out to that station.
