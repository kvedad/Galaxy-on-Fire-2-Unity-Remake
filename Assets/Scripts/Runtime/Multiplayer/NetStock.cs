// NetStock.cs
// Multiplayer: every station's shop stock (the items and the dealer's ships) is shared by all players. The host keeps one
// list per station, made with the single-player rules (Shop.GenerateItems / GenerateShips) the first time a player docks
// there, and made again every ResetSeconds (instead of the single-player re-roll after 3 other stations and the nibbling
// on re-docking); every player docked there gets it (NetState.StockRpc) and it replaces their own list in place
// (StationStock.items / ships; the bar's agents stay each player's). A trade is sent to the host (a bought or sold unit, a
// dealer row swapped), which applies it and sends the list to everyone docked there, so they see it at once (the hangar
// window rebuilds, StationMenu). Not shared: the owned Kaamo Club's storage (108) and a Stolen goods mission's documents
// (only its team sees them, Freelance.OnEnterStation; one member buying them takes them for the squad).
// The host decides: a unit it no longer has (another player bought the last one) is taken back from the buyer and paid
// back (ItemRefused); a dealer ship is reserved with the host before the trade (ReserveShip). Until the host's list is
// here the docked player's list is empty (no trade against a list of their own). The host's lists get the stations'
// docking extras (HostExtras: Kappa's EMP GL I at free play, energy cells at the deep science stations). Lists arriving
// are applied between frames (Flush), never in the middle of a trade. The host checks each trade (NetState: the trader is
// docked there, one unit of an item that exists, a dealer row only as reserved: the reserved one back or the trader's old
// hull), sends the list once per frame however many units changed, and caps a row (MaxRowAmount) and the dealer list
// (MaxShips), so no client grows the list everyone docked there receives.
// Rare goods (players' report: Buskat at Sao Perula was back after one other system): commodities worth RarePrice or more
// (Buskat, Vossk Organs, Implants, the add-ons' rare goods) don't come back with the 15-minute list. Each list's roll sets
// how many of each the station should have (Entry.rareTarget: the roll's amount, 0 when the roll has none), what is left
// is kept, and every RareStepSeconds a sold-out or short row gets a third of its target back: empty to full in 30 minutes.
