// NetProxy.cs
// An orbit authority's NPC ship shown to the other players in that orbit (NetOrbit asks NetState to spawn one per living
// ship of its traffic; the host spawns it owned by that player). The owner follows the ship's model and writes its pose,
// race, standing toward the player (hostile / friend / neutral), hull fraction, hit cube and whether it is hidden
// (cloaked, a sleeping Most Wanted criminal); the others load the same assembled prefab (its Resources path) at that scale
// and smooth its motion (NetSmoothing), but only while they are in that orbit themselves (else it is hidden). There it is a
// Target in Target.NetShips, so the radar locks it and the HUD marks it like a traffic ship; hits on it (guns, missiles) go
// to the owner's ship (Target.RemoteDamage), which takes them as its own player's hits. Its life follows the ship's state:
// dying (the tumble or wreck animation: no marker, no lock, the pose still followed), dead (the explosion at its scale,
// the model hidden unless it leaves a wreck: freighters, fixed objects), flying again after a relaunch. Its shots (every
// gun, missiles and blasts included) are mirrored (NetShotSender -> NetShotMirror). Despawned when the ship leaves, or its
// owner leaves the orbit (NetOrbit, NetState). Another player's EMP reaches the owner's ship too (NpcShip.OnRemoteEmp), an
// EMP-disabled ship shows its lightning to everyone, and the player whose hit destroyed it gets the kill (their own
// standing and kill count, KillCreditRpc). The markers' colours follow each player's own standings and squad. A freelance
// mission's ships look like any other ship to players outside the mission's team: no mission name on the lock plate
// (the Hijacker, the Wanted target, the Challenge rival); their kills still help the team (NetMissions). A mission ship
// also carries its part in the mission (FreelanceOrbit.RoleFlags) and its hull, so a squadmate taking the mission orbit
// over adopts it with its role (FreelanceOrbit.Promote). Its creator (the player whose game has the ship) stays known
// after an owner change: the host holding a disconnected player's proxies shows them like anyone else (viewer mode) until
// they are taken over or swept. Its owner drops a proxy whose ship is gone before it spawned.
// Hits, EMP, shots and kill credits go through the server's checks (DamageUpRpc, ShotUpRpc, KillCreditUpRpc: the shooter
// flies in this ship's orbit, sane values, a credit only for a player who hit it a moment ago, once).
