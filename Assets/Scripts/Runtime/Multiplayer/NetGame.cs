// NetGame.cs
// Remake-only multiplayer (Netcode for GameObjects over Unity Transport): one shared game world. Online sessions go
// through Unity Relay (Multiplayer Services: the host gets a join code, the others join with it, no address or port
// forwarding; anonymous Unity Authentication), listed in the server browser unless the host keeps it to its code
// (NetLobby, Unity Lobby); local ones by direct IP, port 7777.
// The main menu's Multiplayer panel hosts or joins; every player starts a fresh free-play game docked at Dis (70) and then
// plays it like single player: their own scenes (Space for their orbit, Station for their hangar), economy, jumps and
// docking. No scene synchronisation: the network objects live in DontDestroyOnLoad and each player shows only what is
// where they are.
//   NetState      the world (spawned by the host): the world seed (every orbit's asteroid field), destroyed asteroids per
//                 station, the spawn / despawn requests of the players who run an orbit.
//   NetPlayer     one per player: where they are (station; in space, in the hangar, taking off), their ship, pose, name,
//                 hull; in space the others there see the ship, in a hangar the others docked there see it land, park
//                 and take off (NetHangar, HangarTraffic's guests).
//   NetOrbit      a player's own Space level: the first player in an orbit runs its NPC traffic and crates (the orbit
//                 authority) and shows them to the others there as NetProxy / NetCrate objects it owns; the others' levels
//                 build no traffic. Asteroids: the same field for everyone, destruction shared.
//   Shots, hits on proxies and crate claims go between the players in the same orbit (NetShotSender / NetShotMirror,
//   NetProxy, NetCrate). Not yet: handing an orbit's NPCs over when its authority leaves (they go with it),
//   player-versus-player damage, NPCs attacking other players than the authority. The players can't die (game over
//   would load a save), nothing is saved to the single-player slots (SaveGame), and the game never pauses
//   (Time.timeScale stays 1). A dedicated server keeps player profiles instead (NetProfiles / NetProfileClient).
// Network prefabs: Resources/GoF2Net (GoF2 > Build > Network Prefabs).
