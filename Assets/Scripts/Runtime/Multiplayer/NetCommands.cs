// NetCommands.cs
// Chat commands: a line typed in the chat that starts with "/" is a command, never sent as chat (NetChat.Send). Every
// command that acts on the session runs on the server (ServerCommands): the chat sends its name and arguments
// (NetState.ServerCommandRpc), the server checks the sender's rights and runs it, and its answer comes back as a notice
// only the sender sees. The dedicated server's console runs the very same commands (RunOnServer with no issuer: every
// right, named "Server"). Only the commands that just change or read this game stay here (help, netstats, pos).
// Each command says who may use it (`available` here for /help and the suggestions, `allowed` on the server, which
// decides). Typing "/" lists the matching commands over the chat line and Tab completes / cycles them, and a player name
// after the commands that take one (ChatView, Completions).
// This game:
//   /help                      the commands this player can use
//   /netstats                  shows / hides the network stats over the HUD (NetStats)
//   /version                   this game's build (BuildVersion.Text)
//   /pos                       your orbit and game coordinates (what /tp takes)
// The server (the console without the "/"):
//   /players                   everyone in the session: where they are, their ship, squad, admin (admins and the console:
//                              their client ids too)
//   /g <text>, /l <text>       one line to Global / Local without switching the channel (the console: g = its say)
//   /w <player> <text>         a private message to that player only
//   /invite <player>           a squad invitation (docked at the same station, like the pilot list's Invite)
//   /leave                     leaves the arena queue or match (NetArena), else the squad
//   /kick <player> [reason]    admins: drops a player (never the host's own player; only the host removes an admin); on a
//                              server with profiles NetModeration's kick (ops too, a rejoin cooldown in minutes)
//   /tp [player] <player | station [x y z | dock]>   admins: teleports (NetTeleport) a player (the chat: yourself by
//                              default) to a player, an orbit (at the launch spot or game coordinates) or a station's hangar
//   /tphere <player>           admins: brings a player to you
//   /kill, /heal, /give, /credits, /spawn, /mute, /unmute, /ship, /ammo, /reveal, /peace, /cheat, /title, /timer
//                              admins: NetAdmin (destroy, repair, items, credits, NPC ships and objects, chat muting, the
//                              debug panel's tools for one player: fly any hull, refill, reveal the map, make peace, a
//                              cheat toggle for the session; a title and a countdown on screen, EventScreen)
//   /dialog [players] <speaker> : <text> [| page ...]   admins: the dialogue window with a story speaker's or a race's face
//   /reward [players] <credits | item [amount]> [+ ...] [| title]   admins: a payout in the mission reward box
//   /event <name | stop | list>  admins: runs an event graph (EventRunner: game modes such as waves of enemies)
//   /news <text | clear>       admins: a GalNet item on every station's news ticker (NetNews)
//   /admin, /unadmin <player>  the host: makes a player an admin for the session / takes it back (with profiles: the
//                              master admin, NetModeration, kept on the profile)
// A dedicated server with player profiles adds (their own handlers answer them): moderation by the profiles' roles
// (NetModeration: /tempban /ban /unban /bans /op /deop /staff /say /disband /deleteprofile /settings /set /claimadmin;
// /web a login code for the web admin, WebAdmin),
// the profiles (NetProfiles: /link /control /profile) and factions (NetFactions: /faction, /f); everywhere the arena matches
// (NetArena: /duel /accept /decline /ffa /arena /top) and, this game's own, the squad's distress calls (NetDistress:
// /sos, /assist <player>).
// Admins: the host's own player always, else the players the host or the server console made admins (IPilot.IsAdmin,
// for the session only: names aren't verified, so nothing is remembered by name), and on a server with profiles the
// profiles' admins and masters (NetPlayer.StaffRole, NetModeration).
// Players are named whole and case-insensitively, the longest name the arguments start with ("Player 2 hi"), by a client
// id as the first word, or by a selector like Minecraft's (FindTargets): @a everyone, @s yourself, @p the nearest other
// player, @r a random other player, and by state @alive (in space, not destroyed), @space, @docked, @dead (destroyed in
// space), @survivors (an event's players never destroyed since its fight began, EventRunner.Survived), @team (the event's
// players: a bar mission's team; while a mission's event runs a line, every selector only finds its team: Scope), any of them narrowed
// to one orbit by [orbit=<station>] (in its space or docked at its station: "@alive[orbit=78]", "@r[orbit=Var Hastra]");
// a command on several players runs for each ("/tp @a 78 dock", "/kick @r", "/reward @survivors 1000").
